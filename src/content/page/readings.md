Textbook for general introduction to social data science:  
- **[Big by Bit - Social research in the digital age](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/)** by Matthew J. Salganik **[BBB]**, free online version [here](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/preface/).

Textbooks for data science in Python   
- **[Python for Data Analysis, 2nd ed.](http://wesmckinney.com/pages/book.html)** (2017) by Wes McKinney **[PDA]**

## Preparation and Assignment 0

The course begin with your preparation for the teaching. This consists in Assignment 0 which is a learning module and assignment together. In terms of teaching it provides  an overview of basic Python and how to use it for data analysis. We also introduce markdown for writing text that allows simple formatting in plain text.

#### Required reading

- DataCamp 2016, ‘Jupyter tutorial’, available [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook)
- PDA: sections 1.1-1.3, 4.1, 5.1-5.2 as well chapters 2-3.

#### Inspirational reading and other sources for learning

There are many good resources for learning how to master data structuring. See below for two ways of self-learning:

- DataCamp offers further smaller courses on pandas and data structuring
- Rada, Greg. 2013. "[Intro to pandas data structures](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/)"- read all three sections.


## Session 1a & 1b: Introduction to the course and Python

We introduce the course and provide an overview of logistics. We also introduce git and GitHub that we are wokring with.

#### Required readings

## Session 2: Strings, queries and APIs

We start to leverage our python knowledge to make queries on the web. This allows us to pull data directly from Statistics Denmark's API.

#### Required reading

## Session 3: Intro to visualization

We introduce visualizations in Python. We use [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html). Both these modules are built on the fundamental and flexible plotting module [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).

## Session 5: Data structuring 2

We round-off data structuring by learning two powerful tools in data structuring: combining different data sets and the-split-apply-combine framework which is called `groupby` in pandas.
